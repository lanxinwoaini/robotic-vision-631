How to use the KX1400 software

look at example code, basically it uses a script file to generate the output intel hex formatted audio file to put onto eeprom.
Example

sequence Sound1()
	unmute;
	playADPCM("Synth_Loop.wav");		// Import and convert a .WAV file to 4-bit ADPCM samples.
	mute;
	stop;
end


playlist
	addrwidth=16;
	Sound1;
	
end

all .wav files need to be RIFF format and be 16-bit 8Khz wav files.  If they are not in this format use audacity to convert them.

you then need to compile this outside the editor because it will not create the correct file for a 16-bit addressable memory.

the command is c:\\mlp.exe -a16 -x "fileName.kml" "fileName.hex"
This outputs an Intel Hex formatted file.  You then need to download a converter and convert it into binary.  It is now ready to be transfered
to the sound chip!
